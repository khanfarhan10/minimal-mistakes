## **Abstract**

A common problem faced while handling multi-featured datasets is the high amount of dimensionality that they often consist of, leading to barriers in generalized hands-on Machine Learning. These datasets also give a drastic impact on the performance of Machine Learning algorithms, being memory inefficient and frequently leading to model overfitting. It often becomes difficult to visualize or gain insightful knowledge on the data features such as presence of outliers.

This chapter will help data analysts reduce data dimensionality using various methodologies such as:<br>

1. Feature Selection using Covariance Matrix
2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
3. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE)

Under applications of Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms with Visualizations, firstly, we introduce the Boston Housing Dataset and use the Correlation Matrix to apply Feature Selection on the strongly correlated data and perform Simple Linear Regression over the new features.Then we use UCI Breast Cancer Dataset to perform PCA Analysis with Support Vector Machine Classification (SVM). Lastly, we apply t-SNE to MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset and use k-Nearest Neighbours (kNNs) clustering for classification.

Finally, we explore the benefits of using Dimensionality Reduction Methods and provide a comprehensive overview of reduction in storage space, efficient models,feature selection guidelines ,redundant data removal and outlier analysis.

**_Keywords : Dimensionality Reduction, Feature Selection, Covariance Matrix, PCA , t-SNE_**

_In the field of artificial intelligence, data explosion has created a plethora of input data & features to be fed into machine learning algorithms. Since most of the real-world data is multi-dimensional in nature, data scientists & data analysts require the core concepts of dimensionality reduction mechanisms for better :_<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_(i) Data Intuition : Visualization, Outlier Detection & Noise Reduction_<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_(ii) Performance Efficiency : Faster Training Intervals & Reduced Computational Processing Time_<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_(iii) Generalization : Prevents Overfitting (High Variance & Low Bias)_<br/><br/>
_This chapter introduces the practical working implementation of these reduction algorithms in applied machine learning._

<i>Multiple features make it difficult to obtain valuable insights into data, as the visualization plots obtained can be 3-Dimensional at most. Due to this limitation, dependent properties/operations such as Outlier Detection and Noise Removal become more and more non-intuitive to perform on these humongous datasets. Therefore, applying dimensionality reduction helps in identifying these properties more effortlessly.</i>

<i>Due to this reduced/compressed form of data, faster mathematical operations such as Scaling, Classification, Regression can be performed. Also, the data is more cleansed and this further solves the issues of overfitting a model.</i>

<i>
Dimensionality Reduction can be broadly classified into :<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Feature Selection Techniques : Feature Selection attempts to train the machine learning model by selectively choosing a subset of the original feature set based on some criteria. Hence, redundant and obsolete characteristics could be eliminated without much information loss. Examples - Correlation Matrix Thresholding & Chi Squared Test Selection.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Feature Extraction/Projection Techniques : This method projects the original input features from the high dimensional space by summarizing most statistics and removing redundant data / manipulating to create new relevant output features with reduced dimensionality (fewer dimensional space). Examples - Principle Component Analysis (PCA) , Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding(t-SNE) & Isometric Mapping (IsoMap).<br/><br/></i>

_However, we have limited our discussion to Correlation Matrices, PCA & t-SNE only, as covering all such techniques is beyond the scope of this book chapter._

#### 2.1.1 **Importing the Modules**

We will need 3 datasets for this chapter, each of which have been documented on our [github repository](https://github.com/khanfarhan10/DIMENSIONALITY_REDUCTION).
Hence we will create a local copy (clone) of that repo here.

<!--You can read more about git and github here.??-->

```python
!git clone https://github.com/khanfarhan10/DIMENSIONALITY_REDUCTION.git
```

    Cloning into 'DIMENSIONALITY_REDUCTION'...

#### 2.1.4 **Pearson Coefficient Correlation Matrix**

The **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** (also known as the Pearson R Test) is a very useful statistical formulae that measures the strength between features and relations.
Mathematically,

$$
r_{xy}=\frac{N \Sigma x y-(\Sigma x)(\Sigma y)}{\sqrt{\left[N \Sigma x^{2}-(\Sigma x)^{2}\right]\left[N \Sigma y^{2}-(\Sigma y)^{2}\right]}}
$$

where  
$$r_{xy}$$ = Pearson's Correlation Coefficient between variables x & y  
$$N$$ = number of pairs of x & y variables in the data  
$$\Sigma x y$$ = sum of products between x & y variables  
$$\Sigma x $$ = sum of x values  
$$\Sigma y $$ = sum of y values  
$$\Sigma x^{2}$$ = sum of squared x values  
$$\Sigma y^{2}$$ = sum of squared y values

For all feaure variables $$f_{i}$$ $$\epsilon$$ $$F$$ arranged in any order , with $$n(F) = N$$  
The Correlation Coefficient Matrix is $$M_{N \times N}$$ , where  
$$M_{ij}$$ = $$r_{ij}$$ , $$i,j$$ $$\epsilon$$ $$F$$

We will now use Pandas to get the correlation matrix and plot a heatmap using Seaborn.

<!--
r=\frac{\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)}{\sqrt{\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^{2} \sum\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}}}

$r=\frac{\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)}{\sqrt{\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^{2} \sum\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}}}$

$$

\begin{equation}
r=\frac{\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)}{\sqrt{\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^{2} \sum\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}}}

The Pearson correlation coefficient is a very helpful statistical formula that measures the strength between variables and relationships. In the field of statistics, this formula is often referred to as the Pearson R test. When conducting a statistical test between two variables, it is a good idea to conduct a Pearson correlation coefficient value to determine just how strong that relationship is between those two variables.

https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/correlation-coefficient-formula/

where
r	=	correlation coefficient
$x_{i}$	=	values of the x-variable in a sample
$\bar{x}$	=	mean of the values of the x-variable
$y_{i}$	=	values of the y-variable in a sample
$\bar{y}$	=	mean of the values of the y-variable

-->

```python
correlation_matrix = df.corr().round(2) #default method = ‘pearson’, also available : ‘kendall’, ‘spearman’ correlation coefficients
plt.figure(figsize=(20,10)) #set the figure size to display
sns.heatmap(data=correlation_matrix,cmap="inferno", annot=True)  # annot = True to print the values inside the squares
plt.savefig("Correlation_Data.png",dpi=600)
```

#### 2.1.5 **Detailed Correlation Matrix Analysis**

The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1. If the value is close to 1, it means that there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables and both increase or decrease simultaneously. When it is close to -1, the relationship between the variables is negatively correlated, or as one value increases, the other decreases.

**Observations:**  
To fit a linear regression model, we select those features which have a high correlation with our target variable <code>MEDV</code>. By looking at the correlation matrix we can see that <code>RM</code> has a strong positive correlation with <code>MEDV (0.7)</code> where as <code>LSTAT (-0.74)</code> has a high negative correlation with <code>MEDV</code>. An important point in selecting features for a linear regression model is to check for **Multi Collinearity** : features that are strongly correlated to other features and are therefore redundant. The features <code>RAD</code>, <code>TAX</code> have a correlation of <code>0.91</code>. These feature pairs are strongly correlated to each other . We should not select both these features together for training the model. The same goes for the features <code>DIS</code> and <code>AGE</code> which have a correlation of <code>-0.75</code>. Except for a manual analysis of the correlation, the function below computes the strongly correlated features to the target variable <code>MEDV</code> :

```python
thres_range=(-0.7,0.7)  # provide the upper and lower limits for thresholding the strongly correlated features
target_variable="MEDV"  # provide the target variable name

def get_strong_corr(correlation_matrix,target_variable,thres_range=(-0.65,0.65)):
  """
  Get the strongly positive and strongly negatively correlated components from the provided correlation matrix.
  Assigns values inside boundary to 0 and returns non zero entries as a Pandas Series.
  correlation_matrix : The correlation matrix obtained from the data.
  target_variable    : The name of the target variable that we need to calculate the correlation for.
  thres_range        : The thresholding range for the calculation of strongly correlated data.
  """
  thres_min,thres_max=thres_range                                       # assign minimum and maximum values passed to threshold
  target_row=correlation_matrix[target_variable]                        # get the row with the target variable name
  target_row[(target_row > thres_min) & (target_row < thres_max)]=0     # assign values out of given threshold to zero
  indices_thresholded=target_row.to_numpy().nonzero()                   # remove the zero values from the filtered target row and get indices
  strong_corr=list(correlation_matrix.columns[indices_thresholded])     # extract feature names from their respective indices

Based on the above observations and discussions we will use <code>RM</code> and <code>LSTAT</code> as our features. Using a scatter plot let’s see how these features vary with <code>MEDV</code>.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(25,10))                                    # initialize the figure with a figure size

features = ['LSTAT', 'RM']                                     # features to display over the dataset

for i, col in enumerate(features):                             # loop over the features with count
    plt.subplot(1, len(features) , i+1)                        # subplotting
    x = df[col]                                                # getting the column values from the dataframe
    plt.scatter(x, target, marker='o',color="cyan")            # performing a scatterplot in matplotlib over x & target

    plt.ylabel(target_variable)
```

#### 2.1.6 **3-Dimensional Data Visualization**

The added advantage of performing Dimensionality Reduction is that 3-D visualizations are now possible over the input features (<code>LSTAT</code> & <code>RM</code>) and the target output(<code>MEDV</code>). These visual interpretations of the data help us obtain a concise overview of the model hypothesis complexity that needs to be considered to prevent overfitting.

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go                      # plotly provides interactive 3D plots
from plotly.graph_objs.layout.scene import XAxis, YAxis, ZAxis

df_sampled= df.sample(n = 100,random_state=univ_seed)  # use random sampling to avoid cumbersome overcrowded plots

LSTAT, RM, MEDV = df_sampled["LSTAT"], df_sampled["RM"], df_sampled["MEDV"]

# set the Plot Title , Axis Labels , Tight Layout , Theme
layout = go.Layout(
    title="Boston Dataset 3-Dimensional Visualizations",
    scene = dict( xaxis = XAxis(title='LSTAT'), yaxis = YAxis(title='RM'), zaxis = ZAxis(title='MEDV'), ),
    margin=dict(l=0, r=0, b=0, t=0),
    template="plotly_dark"
)

# create the scatter plot with required hover information text
trace_scatter= go.Scatter3d(
    x=LSTAT,
    y=RM,
    z=MEDV,
    mode='markers',
    marker=dict(
        size=12,
        color=MEDV,
        showscale=True,         # set color to an array/list of desired values
        colorscale='inferno',   # choose a colorscale: viridis
        opacity=0.8
    ),
    text= [f"LSTAT: {a}<br>RM: {b}<br>MEDV: {c}" for a,b,c in list(zip(LSTAT,RM,MEDV))],
    hoverinfo='text'
)

#get the figure using the layout on the scatter trace
fig = go.Figure(data=[trace_scatter],layout=layout)

**Conclusions based on Visual Insights :**

- Home Prices(<code>MEDV</code>) tend to decrease with the increase in <code>LSTAT</code>. The curve follows a linear - semi-quadratic equation in nature.

- Home Prices(<code>MEDV</code>) tend to increase with the increase in <code>RM</code> linearly. There are few outliers present in the dataset as clearly portrayed by the 3-D Visualization.

#### 2.1.7 **Extracting the Features and Target**

Extract the Input Feature Variables in $$X$$ & Output Target Variable in $$y$$.

```python
X = pd.DataFrame(np.c_[df['LSTAT'], df['RM']], columns = ['LSTAT', 'RM']) # concatenate LSTAT and RM columns using numpy np.c_ function
y = df['MEDV']                                                            # store the target column median value of homes (MEDV) in y
print('Dataframe Shapes : ','Shape of X : {} , Shape of y : {}'.format(X.shape,y.shape)) # print the shapes of the Input and Output Variables
X=X.to_numpy()    # Convert the Input Feature DataFrame X to a NumPy Array
y=y.to_numpy()    # Convert the Output Target DataFrame y to a NumPy Array
y=y.reshape(-1,1) # Shorthand method to reshape numpy array to single column format
print('Array Shapes : ','Shape of X : {} , Shape of y : {}'.format(X.shape,y.shape))     # print the shapes of the Input and Output Variables
```

    Dataframe Shapes :  Shape of X : (506, 2) , Shape of y : (506,)
    Array Shapes :  Shape of X : (506, 2) , Shape of y : (506, 1)

#### 2.1.8 **Feature Scaling**

Feature scaling/standardization helps machine learning models converge faster to a global optima by transforming the data to have zero mean and a unit variance of 1 hence making the data unitless.

$$
x^{\prime}=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
$$

where  
$$x$$= Input Feature Variable  
$$x^{\prime}$$ = Standardized Value of $x$  
$$\mu$$= Mean value of $$x$$ ($$\bar{x}$$)  
$$\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\sum\left(x_{i}-\mu\right)^{2}}{N}}$$ (Standard Deviation)  
$$x_{i}$$ = Each value in $$x$$  
$$N$$ = No. of Observations in $$x$$ (Size of $$x$$)

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler_x = StandardScaler()
X_scaled= scaler_x.fit_transform(X)

scaler_y = StandardScaler()
y_scaled = scaler_y.fit_transform(y)
```

#### 2.1.9 **Create Training and Testing Dataset**

Splitting the data into Test and Train Sets:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y_scaled, test_size = 0.3, random_state=univ_seed)
print('Shape of X_train : {} , Shape of X_test : {}'.format(X_train.shape,X_test.shape))
print('Shape of y_train : {} , Shape of y_test : {}'.format(y_train.shape,y_test.shape))
```

    Shape of X_train : (354, 2) , Shape of X_test : (152, 2)
    Shape of y_train : (354, 1) , Shape of y_test : (152, 1)

#### 2.1.10 **Training and Evaluating ML Models with Reduced Dataset**

**Multivariate Linear Regression :**

_Model Training - Ordinary Least Squares :_
Here we will attempt to fit a linear regression model which would map the input features $$x_{i}$$ (<code>LSTAT</code> & <code>RM</code>) to $y$ (<code>MEDV</code>). Hence the model hypothesis :
$$h_{\Theta}(x)=\Theta_{0} + \Theta_{1}x_{1} + \Theta_{2}x_{2}$$
where  
$$y$$ = Output Target Variable <code>MEDV</code>  
$$x_{1}$$ = Input Feature Variable <code>LSTAT</code>  
$$x_{2}$$ = Input Feature Variable <code>RM</code>  
$$\Theta$$ = Model Parameters (to obtain)

We perform Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression using the scikit-learn library to obtain $$\Theta_{i}$$.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

lin_model = LinearRegression()
lin_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

points_to_round=2
theta= list(lin_model.coef_.flatten().round(points_to_round))+list(lin_model.intercept_.flatten().round(points_to_round))
print("Model Parameters Obtained : ",theta)  # merge the values of theta 1 and theta 2 (coef_) and the value of theta 0 (intercept_)
```

    Model Parameters Obtained :  [-0.52, 0.38, 0.01]

```python
def get_model_params(theta,features,target_variable):
  """Pretty Print the Features with the Model Parameters"""
  text = target_variable + " = " + str(theta[0])
  for t, x in zip ( theta[1:], features) :
    text += " + "+ str(t) + " * " + str(x)
  return text
features=['LSTAT','RM']
print(get_model_params(theta,features,target_variable))
```

    MEDV = -0.52 + 0.38 * LSTAT + 0.01 * RM

_Model Evaluation - Regression Metrics :_  
We need to calculate the following values in order to evaluate our model.

- Mean Absolute Error(MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-Squared Value (coefficient of determination)

<!--
- Mean Absolute Error(MAE)

$$
\operatorname{MAE}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left|y_{i}-x_{i}\right|}{n}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mathrm{MAE}=\text { mean absolute error } \\
\begin{aligned}
y_{i} &=\text { prediction } \\
x_{i} &=\text { true value } \\
n &=\text { total number of data points }
\end{aligned}
\end{array}
$$

- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

$$
R M S E=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\left(\hat{y}_{i}-y_{i}\right)^{2}}{n}}
$$

$$\hat{y}_{i}$$ are predicted values
$$y_{i}$$ are observed values
$$n$$ is the number of observations

- R-Squared Value (coefficient of determination)

$$
R^{2}=1-\frac{R S S}{T S S}
$$

$$R^{2}=$$ coefficient of detemination
$$ R S S=$$ sum of squares of residual

$$
R S S=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-f\left(x_{i}\right)\right)^{2}
$$

$$y_{i}$$ = value of the variable to be predicted
$$f\left(x_{i}\right)$$ = prediced values of $$y_{i}$$
$$n$$ = upper limit of summation
$$T S S=$$ total sum of squares
$$\mathrm{TSS}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}$$
$$n$$ = number of observations
$$y_{i}$$ = value in a sample
$$\bar{y}$$ = mean value of a sample

-->

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score

def getevaluation(model, X_subset,y_subset,subset_type="Train",round_scores=None):
  y_subset_predict = model.predict(X_subset)
  rmse = (np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_subset, y_subset_predict)))
  r2 = r2_score(y_subset, y_subset_predict)
  mae=mean_absolute_error(y_subset, y_subset_predict)
  if round_scores!=None:
    rmse=round(rmse,round_scores)
    r2=round(r2,round_scores)
    mae=round(mae,round_scores)

  print("Model Performance for {} subset :: RMSE: {} | R2 score: {} | MAE: {}".format(subset_type,rmse,r2,mae))

getevaluation(model=lin_model,X_subset=X_train,y_subset=y_train,subset_type="Train",round_scores=2)
getevaluation(model=lin_model,X_subset=X_test,y_subset=y_test,subset_type="Test ",round_scores=2)
```

    Model Performance for Train subset :: RMSE: 0.6 | R2 score: 0.65 | MAE: 0.43
    Model Performance for Test  subset :: RMSE: 0.59 | R2 score: 0.6 | MAE: 0.44

#### 2.1.11 **Limitations of the Correlation Matrix Analysis**

Correlation Coefficients are a vital parameter when applying Linear Regression on your Datasets. However it is limited as :

- Only **LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS** are being considered as candidates for mapping of the target to the features. However, most mappings are non-linear in nature.
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression is **SUSCEPTABLE TO OUTLIERS** and may learn an inaccurate hypothesis from the noisy data.
- There may be non-linear variables other than the ones chosen with Pearson Coefficient Correlation Thresholding, which have been discarded, but do **PARTIALLY INFLUENCE** the output variable.
- A strong correlation assumes a direct change in the input variable would reflect back immediately into the output variable, but there exist some variables that are **SELECTIVELY INDEPENDENT** in nature yet they provide a suitably high value of the correlation coefficient.

### 2.2 **_t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE)_**

**Objective :** Introduce MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset and obtained the reduced t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding) Features to perform k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbours) Classification over the digits.

<!--

-->

#### 2.2.1 **The MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset**

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology Database) is a large database of handwritten digits which is widely used worldwide as a benchmark dataset, often used by various Machine Learning classifiers.

The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images & each image size is 28x28 pixels with all images being grayscale.

Importing the dataset :  
The MNIST dataset is built into scikit-learn and can be obtained from its datasets API from [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/) using the following code :

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml   # to fetch the dataset
mnist = fetch_openml("mnist_784")           # get the dataset from openml.org
X = mnist.data / 255.0                      # since images are in the range 0-255 , normalize the features
y = mnist.target                            # store the target
print("Size of Input Variable (X) : ",X.shape,"Size of Target Variable (y) : ", y.shape) # get shapes

feat_cols = [ 'pixel'+str(i) for i in range(X.shape[1]) ] # convert num to pixelnum for column names
df = pd.DataFrame(X,columns=feat_cols)                    # create dataframe using variables
df['y'] = y                                               # store the target in dataframe
df['label'] = df['y'].apply(lambda i: str(i))             # convert numerical values to string literals
X, y = None, None                                         # calling destructor by reassigning, saves space
print('Size of the dataframe: {}'.format(df.shape))       # get dataframe shape
```

    Size of Input Variable (X) :  (70000, 784) Size of Target Variable (y) :  (70000,)
    Size of the dataframe: (70000, 786)

#### 2.2.2 **Perform Exploratory Data Visualization**

Since the dataframe is not human readable, we will view the rows as images from the dataset. To choose the images we will use a random permutation :

```python
rndperm = np.random.permutation(df.shape[0])     # random permutation to be used later for data viz

plt.gray()                                       # set the colormap to “gray”
fig = plt.figure( figsize=(20,9) )               # initilaize the figure with the figure size

for i in range(0,15):
    # use subplots to get 3x5 matrix of random handwritten digit images
    ax = fig.add_subplot(3,5,i+1, title="Digit: {}".format(str(df.loc[rndperm[i],'label'])) )
    ax.matshow(df.loc[rndperm[i],feat_cols].values.reshape((28,28)).astype(float))
    ax.set_xticks([])                             # set the xtciks and yticks as blanks
    ax.set_yticks([])

plt.show()                                        # display the figure
```

![MNIST_DIGITS.png](/assets/images/DIM_REDN/MNIST_DIGITS.png)

#### 2.2.3 **Random Sampling of the Large Dataset**

Since the dataset is huge , we will use random sampling from the dataset to reduce computational time keeping the dataset characteristics. The operations performed on the original dataset can now be performed on this sampled dataset with faster results & similar behaviour.

```python
N = 10000                                  # number of rows to be sampled
df_subset = df.loc[rndperm[:N],:].copy()   # generate random permutation of number of rows and copy them to subset dataframe
data_subset = df_subset[feat_cols].values  # get the numpy array of this dataframe and store it is subset data
```

#### 2.2.4 **T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbouring Entities (t-SNE) - An Introduction**

t-SNE is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm that is commonly used to reduce complex problems with linearly nonseparable data, i.e., data that cannot be separated by any straight line such as :

![Non_Linearly_Separable_Data.jpg](/assets/images/DIM_REDN/Non_Linearly_Separable_Data.jpg)

#### 2.2.5 **Probability & Mathematics behind t-SNE**

Provided a set of features $$x_{i}$$ , t-SNE computes the proportional probability ($$p_{ij}$$) of object similarity between $$x_{i}$$ & $$x_{j}$$ using the following relation :

For $$i≠j$$,

$$
p_{j \mid i}=\frac{\exp \left(-\left\|\mathbf{x}_{i}-\mathbf{x}_{j}\right\|^{2} / 2 \sigma_{i}^{2}\right)}{\sum_{k \neq i} \exp \left(-\left\|\mathbf{x}_{i}-\mathbf{x}_{k}\right\|^{2} / 2 \sigma_{i}^{2}\right)}
$$

For $$i=j$$,

$$
p_{i \mid i} = 0
$$

where $$\sigma^{2}$$ is the variance.

Further $$p_{ij}$$ is calculated with the help of the bisection method :

$$
p_{i j}=\frac{p_{j \mid i}+p_{i \mid j}}{2 N}
$$

Also notice that :

- $$
  \sum_{j} p_{j \mid i}=1 \text { for all } i
  $$

- $$p_{ij}=p_{ji}$$
- $$p_{ii}=0$$
- $$\sum_{i,j} p_{ij}=1$$

In simple terms,

Also, $$x_{i}$$ would pick $$x_{j}$$ as its neighbor if neighbors were picked in proportion to their probability density under a Gaussian centered at $$x_{i}$$.

<blockquote>
t-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) minimizes the divergence between two distributions: a distribution that measures pairwise similarities of the input objects and a distribution that measures pairwise similarities of the corresponding low-dimensional points in the embedding

<p align='right'><b>- Van der Maaten & Hinton.</b></p>

Hence, the t-SNE algorithm generates the reduced feature set by synchronizing the probability distributions of the original data and the best represented low dimensional data.

#### 2.2.7 **Implementing & Visualizing t-SNE in 3-D**

Obtaining a 3-Dimensional Overview to t-SNE is essential for better visual observations than the 2-Dimensional overview. The below code is dedicated to the better understanding of t-SNE algorithm.

```python

#### 2.2.8 **Applying k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) on the t-SNE MNIST Dataset**

<blockquote>
The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier determines the category of an observed data point by majority vote of the k closest observations around it.
</blockquote>

The measure of this "closeness" of the data is obtained mathematically using some distance metrics. For our purpose, we will be using the <code>Euclidean Distance(d)</code>, which is simply the length of the straight line connecting two distant points $p_{1}$ & $p_{2}$.

In 1-Dimension, for points $$p_{1}(x_{1})$$ & $$p_{2}(x_{2})$$:

$$
d(p_{1}, p_{2})=\sqrt{\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\right)^{2}}=|x_{1}-x_{2}|
$$

In 2-Dimensions, for points $$p_{1}(x_{1},y_{1})$$ & $$p_{2}(x_{2},y_{2})$$:

$$
d(p_{1}, p_{2})=\sqrt{\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{1}-y_{2}\right)^{2}}
$$

In 3-Dimensions, for points $$p_{1}(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$$ & $$p_{2}(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2})$$:

$$
d(p_{1}, p_{2})=\sqrt{\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{1}-y_{2}\right)^{2}+\left(z_{1}-z_{2}\right)^{2}}
$$

Based on the calculated distance with x, y & z coordinates the algorithm pulls out the closest <code>k</code> neighbors and then does a majority voting for the predictions. However, the value of <code>k</code> diversely affects the algorithm and is an important hyperparameter.

#### 2.2.9 **Data Preparation - Extracting the Features and Target**

Extract the Input Feature Variables in $X$ & Output Target Variable in $y$.

```python
X=reduced_df[["tsne-2d-one", "tsne-2d-two"]].values
y=reduced_df["y"].values
print("X Shape : ", X.shape , "y Shape : ", y.shape)
```

    X Shape :  (10000, 2) y Shape :  (10000,)

#### 2.2.10 **Create Training and Testing Dataset**

Splitting the data into Test and Train Sets:

```python
#train-test split
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=univ_seed)
print ('Train set:', X_train.shape,  y_train.shape)
print ('Test set:', X_test.shape,  y_test.shape)
```

    Train set: (8000, 2) (8000,)
    Test set: (2000, 2) (2000,)

#### 2.2.11 **Choosing the k-NN hyperparameter - k**

**Obtaining the predictions and accuracy scores for each k :**  
Since the optimal value of k for the k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier is not known to us initially, hence we will attempt to find the value of k from a range that provides the best test set evaluation for the model. The model accuracy is the percentage score of correctly classified predictions.

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn import metrics

Ks = 20+1
mean_acc = np.zeros((Ks-1))
mean_acc_train= np.zeros((Ks-1))
std_acc = np.zeros((Ks-1))
std_acc_train = np.zeros((Ks-1))
for n in range(1,Ks):

    #Train Model and Predict
    neigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = n).fit(X_train,y_train)
    yhat=neigh.predict(X_test)
    mean_acc[n-1] = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yhat) #gets the test accuracy
    y_pred=neigh.predict(X_train)
    mean_acc_train[n-1] = metrics.accuracy_score(y_train,y_pred) #gets the train accuracy


    std_acc[n-1]=np.std(yhat==y_test)/np.sqrt(yhat.shape[0])
    std_acc_train[n-1]=np.std(y_pred==y_train)/np.sqrt(y_pred.shape[0])
```

```python
print("MEAN ACCURACY")
length=len(mean_acc)
for i in range(length):
    test_acc='{0:.3f}'.format(round(mean_acc[i],3))
    train_acc='{0:.3f}'.format(round(mean_acc_train[i],3))

    print("K=",f"{i+1:02d}","  Avg. Test Accuracy=",test_acc,"  Avg. Train Accuracy=",train_acc)
```

    MEAN ACCURACY
    K= 01   Avg. Test Accuracy= 0.827   Avg. Train Accuracy= 1.000
    K= 02   Avg. Test Accuracy= 0.840   Avg. Train Accuracy= 0.921

    K= 12   Avg. Test Accuracy= 0.871   Avg. Train Accuracy= 0.885
    K= 13   Avg. Test Accuracy= 0.871   Avg. Train Accuracy= 0.885
    K= 14   Avg. Test Accuracy= 0.870   Avg. Train Accuracy= 0.883

    K= 20   Avg. Test Accuracy= 0.868   Avg. Train Accuracy= 0.878

**Obtaining the best value for k :**

The optimal value for k can be found graphically and analytically as shown :

```python

print( "The best test accuracy was", mean_acc.max(), "with k=", mean_acc.argmax()+1)
print( "The corresponding training accuracy obtained was :",mean_acc_train[mean_acc.argmax()])

plt.figure(figsize=(15,7.5))
#comment the figure sizeif you want a small figure size
plt.plot(range(1,Ks),mean_acc_train,'r',linewidth=5)
plt.plot(range(1,Ks),mean_acc,'g',linewidth=5)
plt.fill_between(range(1,Ks),mean_acc - 1 * std_acc,mean_acc + 1 * std_acc, alpha=0.10)
plt.fill_between(range(1,Ks),mean_acc_train - 1 * std_acc_train,mean_acc_train + 1 * std_acc_train, alpha=0.10)


plt.scatter( mean_acc.argmax()+1,  mean_acc.max())
plt.scatter( mean_acc.argmax()+1,  mean_acc_train[mean_acc.argmax()])
#plt.annotate("BEST_TEST_ACC", ( mean_acc.argmax()+1,  mean_acc.max()))
#plt.annotate("CORRESPONDING_TRAIN_ACC", ( mean_acc.argmax()+1,  mean_acc_train[mean_acc.argmax()]))

plt.legend(('Train_Accuracy ','Test_Accuracy ', '+/- 3xstd_test','+/- 3xstd_train','BEST_TEST_ACC','CORRESPONDING_TRAIN_ACC'))

```

    The best test accuracy was 0.8715 with k= 7
    The corresponding training accuracy obtained was : 0.893875

#### 2.2.12 **Model Evaluation - Jaccard Index, F1 Score, Model Accuracy & Confusion Matrix**

**Model Accuracy :**
It measures the accuracy of the classifier based on the predicted labels and the true labels and is defined as :

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\alpha(y, \hat{y})=\frac{|y \cap \hat{y}|}{|\hat{y}|}=\frac{\text { No. of Correctly Classified Predictions }}{\text { Total No. of Predictions }}
\end{array}
$$

**Jaccard Index :**  
Given the predicted values of the target variable as $$(\hat{y})$$ and true/actual values as $$y$$, the Jaccard index is defined as :

$$
\begin{array}{c}
j(y, \hat{y})=\frac{|y \cap \hat{y}|}{|y \cup \hat{y}|}
=\frac{|y \cap \hat{y}|}{|y|+|\hat{y}|-|y \cap \hat{y}|}
\end{array}
$$

Simplifying,

$$
\begin{array}{c}
j(y, \hat{y})==\frac{\text { No. of Correctly Classified Predictions }}{\text { No. of True Samples }+\text { No. of Predicted Samples }-\text { No. of Correctly Classified Predictions }}
\end{array}
$$

**Confusion Matrix :**  
The confusion matrix is used to provide information about the performance of a categorical classifier on a set of test data for which true values are known beforehand.

![Confusion Matrix](https://i.imgur.com/GZPwoGY.png)
-->

The following information can be extracted from the confusion matrix:

- True positive(TP) : Model correctly predicted Positive cases as Positive. Disease is diagnosed as present and truly is present.
- False positive(FP): Model incorrectly predicted Negative cases as Positive. Disease is diagnosed as present and but is actually absent. (Type I error)
- False Negative:(FN) Model incorrectly predicted Positive cases as Negative. Disease is diagnosed as absent but is actually present. (Type II error)
- True Negative(TN): Model correctly predicted Negative cases as Positive. Disease is diagnosed as absent and is truly absent.

**F1 Score :**

The F1 score is a measure of model accuracy & is calculated based on the precision and recall of each category by obtaining the weighted average of the Precision and Sensitivity (Recall). Precision is the ratio of correctly labelled samples to all samples & Recall is a measure of the frequency in which the positive predictions are taking place.

$$
\text { Precision }=\frac{T P}{T P+F P}
$$

$$
\text { Recall (Sensitivity) }=\frac{T P}{T P+F N}
$$

$$
F 1 \text { Score }=2\left(\frac{\text { Precision } \times \text { Recall }}{\text { Precision }+\text { Recall }}\right)
$$

#### 2.2.13 **Limitations of the t-SNE Algorithm**

Although particularly well suited for visualization of high-dimensional dataset visualizations, there exist the following pitfalls of t-SNE :

- t-SNE scales **QUADRATICALLY** in the number of objects $N$ and hence it is **COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE** & **MEMORY INEFFICIENT**.
- As compared to other dimensionality reduction algorithms, it is often very time consuming and beyond a thousand objects, it is found to be **TOO SLOW TO BE PRACTICAL**.
- Often in the case of very high dimensional data, you may need to **APPLY ANOTHER DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION TECHNIQUE** (such as PCA for dense data or TruncatedSVD for sparse data) before using t-SNE.

### 2.3 **_Breast Cancer Classification using ML_**

**Objective :**

Introduce UCI Breast Cancer Dataset to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and use projected features to train and test a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

#### 2.3.1 **The University of California, Irvine (UCI) Breast Cancer Dataset**

This algorithms defined in this section will be based upon the [UCI breast cancer dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29).

For each cell we have taken ten real valued input features.

- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- perimeter
- area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- compactness ($ \frac{perimeter^{2}}{area - 1.0}$)
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- symmetry
- fractal dimension (coastline approximation-1.0)

**About Breast Cancer :**

**Breast Cancer** develops in breast cells. It can occur in both men and women, though after skin cancer it's one of the most common cancer diagnosed in females. It begins when the cells in the breast start to expand uncontrollably. Eventually these cells form tumors that can be detected via X-Ray or felt as lumps near the breast area.

The main challenge is to classify these tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non cancerous). A tumor is considered as mailgnant if the cells expand into adjacent tissues or migrate to distant regions of the body. A benign tumor doesn't occupy any other nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body like the way cancerous tumors can. But benign tumors may be extreme if the structure of heart muscles or neurons is pressurized.

Machine Learning technique can significantly improve the level of breast cancer diagnosis. Analysis shows that skilled medical professionals can detect cancer with 79% precision, while machine learning algorithms can reach 91% (sometimes up to 97%) accuracy.

**Importing the Dataset :**

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer # scikit learn has an inbuilt dataset library which includes the breast cancer dataset

cancer = load_breast_cancer()                   # load the cancer dataset form sklearn library
```

Let's view the data in a dataframe:

```python
col_names = list(cancer.feature_names)                                  # create a column names of the list of all the variables and add features to it
col_names.append('target')                                              # append the target variable to column names
df = pd.DataFrame(np.c_[cancer.data, cancer.target], columns=col_names) # concatenate the columns using the np.c_ function
```

Construct a column named <code>label</code> that contains the string values of the target mapping :

- <code>1.0 = Benign (non cancerous)</code>.
- <code>0.0 = Malignant (cancerous)</code>.

```python
df['label'] = df['target'].map({0 :'Malignant', 1 : 'Benign'})  # mapping the numerical variables to string target names
print("Shape of df :",df.shape)                                 # display the shape of the dataframe
df.tail(4)                                                      # list the last 4 rows in the dataframe
```

#### 2.3.2 **Perform Basic Data Visualization :**

**Pair Plot :**

A **pairplot** is a combinational plot of both histograms and scatterplots. A **scatterplot** is used to show the relation between different input features. In a scatterplot every datapoint is represented by a dot. The **histograms** on the diagonal show the distribution of a single variable where the scatter plots on the upper and lower triangle show the relation between two variables.

```python
sns.pairplot(df, hue='target', vars=['mean radius', 'mean texture', 'mean perimeter', 'mean area',
                                     'mean smoothness', 'mean compactness', 'mean concavity',
                                     'mean concave points', 'mean symmetry', 'mean fractal dimension'],
             palette=sns.color_palette("tab10",2))
# create scattterplot using Seaborn
plt.savefig("Pairplot Breast Cancer_1.png",dpi=300)
```

![Pairplot Breast Cancer.jpg](/assets/images/DIM_REDN/Pairplot Breast Cancer.jpg)

**Count Plot :**

A **countplot** counts the number of observations for each class of target variable and shows it using bars on each categorical bin.

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize= (5,5))      # create figure with required figure size

categories=["Malignant","Benign"]     # declare the categories of the target variable


ax = sns.countplot(x='label',data=df,palette=sns.color_palette("tab10",len(categories)))
# create countplot from the Seaborn Library

plt.title('Countplot - Target UCI Breast Cancer',fontsize=20)  # set the plot title
plt.xlabel('Target Categories',fontsize=16)                    # set the x labels & y labels
plt.ylabel('Frequency',fontsize=16)

for p in ax.patches:
  ax.annotate('{:.1f}'.format(p.get_height()), (p.get_x()+0.3, p.get_height()+5))
# put the counts on top of the bar plot

plt.savefig("Countplot - Target UCI Breast Cancer.png",dpi=600)

```

#### 2.3.3 **Create Training and Testing Dataset**

Extract the Dataset into Input Feature Variables in $X$ & Output Target Variable in $y$.

```python
X = df.drop(['target','label'], axis=1)  # drop 2 colums : target is numerical (1/0) and label is string.(Malignant/Benign)
y = df.target                            # store the numerical target into y : 0 for Malignant and 1 for Benign

print("Shape of X :",X.shape,"Shape of y :",y.shape)  # displaay the variable shapes
```

    Shape of X : (569, 30) Shape of y : (569,)

#### 2.3.4 **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) : An Introduction**

In higher dimensions, where it isn't possible to find out the patterns between the data points of a dataset, **Principal Component Analysis(PCA)** helps to find out the correlation and patterns between the data points of the dataset so that the data can be compressed from higher dimensional space to lower dimensional space by reducing number of dimensions without any loss of major key data.

This helps in better Data Intuition and Visualization.

**Chronological Steps to compute PCA :**

- Transposing the Data for Usage into Python
- Standardization - Finding the Mean Vector
- Computing the n-dimensional Covariance Matrix
- Calculating the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Covariance Matrix
- Sorting the Eigenvalues and Corresponding Eigenvectors Obtained
- Construct Feature Matrix - Choosing the k Eigenvectors with the Largest Eigenvalues
- Transformation to New Subspace - Reducing Number of Dimensions

We will go through each step in great detail in the following sections.

<!--

- Standardization of the data
- Calculation of Covariance Matrix
- Calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Covariance Matrix
- Choosing the Principal Components
- Derivation of new dataset reducing number of dimensions

-->
<!--
- Here the variable value is standardized using the following equation:
$$z = (variable value - mean)/standard deviation$$
-->

#### 2.3.5 **Transposing the Data for Usage into Python**

Interchanging the rows with columns and vice-versa is termed as the transpose of a matrix.

Mathematically,

$$
X_{m \times n}=|a_{ij}|,\text {for } i,j \text { }\epsilon \text { } m,n
$$

$$
X^{T}_{n \times m}=|a_{ji}|,\text {for } i,j \text { }\epsilon \text { } m,n
$$

```python
X_Transposed=X.T    # create Transpose of the X matrix using numpy .T method

print("Shape of Original Data (X) :",X.shape,"Shape of Transposed Data (X_Transposed)  :",X_Transposed.shape) # display shapes
```

    Shape of Original Data (X) : (569, 30) Shape of Transposed Data (X_Transposed)  : (30, 569)

#### 2.3.6 **Standardization - Finding the Mean Vector**

Here we will use a slightly different approach for standardizing the dataset. By subtracting the mean from each variable value we will have standardized all of the input features.

$$\text{standardized variable value}=\text{initial variable value}-\text{mean}$$

Mathematically,

$$
X^{\prime}=X-\mu
$$

```python
mean_vec = np.mean(X_Transposed,axis=1).to_numpy().reshape(-1,1)  # get the mean vector with proper shape
X_std = X_Transposed - mean_vec                                   # standardize the data
print("Shape of mean vector (mean_vec) :", mean_vec.shape, "Shape of standardized vector (X_std) :", X_std.shape) # display shapes
```

    Shape of mean vector (mean_vec) : (30, 1) Shape of standardized vector (X_std) : (30, 569)

#### 2.3.7 **Computing the n-dimensional Covariance Matrix**

Covariance is a statistical method used to measure how two random variables vary w.r.t. each other. Covariance is used in n-dimension(n>=2). In one dimension Covariance is similar to variance where we determine single variable distribution.

For n number of features, Covariance is calculated using the following formula:

<!--
$$\operatorname{cov}_{x, y}=\frac{\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)}{N-1}$
= data value of = data value of $y$
= mean
$\bar{y} \quad$ = теап оf
$\begin{array}{l}N & \text { = number of data value }\end{array}$$
-->

$$
cov(x,y)=\frac{\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)}{n-1}
$$

$$cov(x,y)$$ = covariance between variable $$x$$ and $$y$$  
$$x_{i}$$ = data value of $$x$$  
$$y_{i}$$ = data value of $$y$$  
$$\bar{x}$$ = mean of $$x$$  
$$\bar{y}$$ = mean of $$y$$  
$$n$$ = number of data values

Note that $$cov(x,y) = cov(y,x)$$, hence the covariance matrix is symmetric across the central diagonal. Also, $$covariance(x,x) = variance(x)$$.

$$
S^{2}=\frac{\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}}{n-1}
$$

where,  
$$S^{2}=$$ sample variance  
$$x_{i}=$$ the value of the one observation  
$$\bar{x}=$$ the mean value of all observations  
$$n=$$ the number of observations

<!--
Symmetricity of Covariance Matrix :
For cov(y,x), we have to calculate (yi - ybar)(xi - xbar) and since multiplication is commutative,
details...
-->

For 3-dimensional dataset(dimensions $$x$$,$$y$$,$$z$$) we have to calculate $$cov(x,y)$$, $$cov(y,z)$$ & $$cov(x,z)$$ and the covariance matrix will look like

$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\operatorname{Cov}(x, x) & \operatorname{Cov}(x, y) & \operatorname{Cov}(x, z) \\
\operatorname{Cov}(y, x) & \operatorname{Cov}(y, y) & \operatorname{Cov}(y, z) \\
\operatorname{Cov}(z, x) & \operatorname{Cov}(z, y) & \operatorname{Cov}(z, z)
\end{array}\right]
$$

& similar calculations follow for higher order datasets.
for n-dimensional dataset number of covariance values = $$\frac{n!}{2(n-2)!}$$

```python
X_covariance=np.cov(X_Transposed)                                       # obtain the covariance matrix using .cov method of numpy

print("Shape of Covariance Matrix (X_covariance) :",X_covariance.shape) # display shapes
```

    Shape of Covariance Matrix (X_covariance) : (30, 30)

#### 2.3.8 **Calculating the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Covariance Matrix**

**EigenValues :**

A Covariance Matrix is always a square matrix, from which we calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Let Covariance Matrix be denoted by $$C$$, then the characteristic equation of this covariance matrix is
$$|C-\lambda I| = 0$$
The roots (i.e. $$\lambda$$ values) of the characteristic equation are called the eigenvalues or characteristic roots of the square matrix $$C_{n\times n}$$.

Therefore eigenvalues of $C$ are roots of the characteristic polynomial
$$\Delta (C-λI) = 0$$

**EigenVectors :**

A non-zero vector $X$ such that $$(C-\lambda I) X = 0$$ or $$C X = \lambda X$$ is called an eigenvector or characteristic vector corresponding to this lambda of matrix $$C_{n\times n}$$.

```python
X_eigvals, X_eigvecs = np.linalg.eig(X_covariance) # Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues using numpy's linear algebra module
print("Shape of eigen values :",X_eigvals.shape,"Shape of eigen vectors :",X_eigvecs.shape)  # display shapes
```

    Shape of eigen values : (30,) Shape of eigen vectors : (30, 30)

#### 2.3.9 **Sorting the Eigenvalues and Corresponding Eigenvectors Obtained**

The eigenvector of the Covariance Matrix with the highest eigenvalues aree to be selected for calculating the Principal Component of that dataset.

In this way we have to find out the eigenvalues of that Covariance Matrix in a **DESCENDING** order. Here we will attempt to sort the eigenvalues along with their corresponding eigenvectors using a pandas dataframe.

```python
eigen_df=pd.DataFrame(data=X_eigvecs,columns=X_eigvals) # create a pandas dataframe of the eigenvalues and the eigen vectors
eigen_df_sorted = eigen_df.reindex(sorted(eigen_df.columns,reverse=True), axis=1) # sort the df columns in a DESCENDING order

print("Shape of original eigen dataframe (eigen_df):",eigen_df.shape,
      "Shape of sorted eigen dataframe (eigen_df_sorted):",eigen_df_sorted.shape) # print shapes

eigen_df_sorted.head(3) # display the first 3 rows in dataframe
```

    Shape of original eigen dataframe (eigen_df): (30, 30) Shape of sorted eigen dataframe (eigen_df_sorted): (30, 30)

#### 2.3.10 **Construct Feature Matrix - Choosing the k Eigenvectors with the Largest Eigenvalues**

Now that we have sorted the eigenvalues, we can get a Matrix that contributes to the Final Principal Components of that dataset in the respective order of significance. The components with lesser importance (corresponding eigenvectors with lesser magnitude of eigenvalues) can be ignored. With these selected eigenvectors of the Covariance Matrix a Feature Vector is constructed.

Here we will attempt to choose the top number of components(<code>k</code>), in our case <code>number of components (no_of_comps) =2</code>.

```python
no_of_comps=2                                                           # select the number of PCA components
feature_matrix = eigen_df_sorted.iloc[:, 0:no_of_comps]                 # extract first k cols from the sorted dataframe
print("Shape of Feature Matrix (feature_matrix):",feature_matrix.shape) # display shape of feature matrix
feature_matrix.head(4)                                                  # display first 4 rows of the feature matrix
```

#### 2.3.11 **Data Transformation - Derivation of New Dataset by PCA - Reduced Number of Dimensions**

The new dataset is derived simply by multiplying the transpose of the feature vector on the left with the standardized data.

<!--
FinalData = (Feature Vector)^T * (Data Adjusted)^T

$$
\text {Final Data}=\text {Feature Vector}^{\intercal} \times \text{Data Adjusted}^{\intercal}
$$
-->
<!--
$$
\text {Transformed PCA Data}=\text {Feature Vector}^{T} \times \text{Data Adjusted}^{T}
$$
-->

$$
\text {Transformed PCA Data}=\text {Feature Vector}^T \cdot \text{Data Standardized}
$$

Then we transpose this matrix to get our Final PCA :

$$
\text {Final PCA}=\text {Transformed PCA Data}^T
$$

```python
feature_matrix_numpy=feature_matrix.values           # converting from pandas dataframe to numpy array

Transformed_PCA = feature_matrix_numpy.T.dot(X_std)  # performm transpose of feature matrix with dot product with Standardized Data

Final_PCA = Transformed_PCA.T                        # perform Transpose of the obtained Transformed Data to get the PCA

print("Shape of Final PCA Data :",Final_PCA.shape)  # display the shape of PCA
```

    Shape of Final PCA Data : (569, 2)

#### 2.3.12 **PCA using Scikit-Learn**

All the tasks mentioned above can be performed using `PCA() ` that is an in-built function of scikit learn library to reduce the dimensions of a dataset.

Here we have performed PCA analysis with our data using `n_components = 2`. The n-components parameter denotes the number of principal components(components with higher significance that means these components have higher eigenvalues corresponding to its eigenvectors as performed stepwise before).

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA             # import the PCA algorithm from the Scikit-Learn Library
pca = PCA(n_components= 2)                        # choose the number of components for PCA
X_PCA = pca.fit_transform(X)                      # fit the PCA algorithm

print("Shape of Scikit Learn PCA :",X_PCA.shape)  # display the shapes of the PCA obtained via Scikit - Learn
```

    Shape of Scikit Learn PCA : (569, 2)

#### 2.3.14 **Verification of Library & Stepwise PCA**

In this section we will verify that the PCA obtained from our steps are the same as the PCA from the Scikit-Learn Library.

For this procedure we will consider that the two PCAs are not identiacal but lie very very close to each other, acccounting for errors crept in due to Rounding Off (Rounding Errors). Hence if the true value is $$T$$ and the observed value $O$ is within the range $$(T \pm \delta)$$ then the observed value is considered nearly equal to the true value, where $$\delta$$ is the allowed tolerance value, set to a very small positive value.

Mathematically,
$$T-\delta<O<T+\delta$$
yields to true, else false.

In other words, we check for :
$$|T-O| \leq \delta$$

We perform this verification using the allclose function of numpy

```python
print(np.allclose(X_PCA, Final_PCA,rtol=0, atol=1e-08))
# use zero relative tolerance and a suitably low value of tolerance to verify that the values obtained Theoretically & Practically Match
```

    True

Now we know that the value of the theoretic PCA calculated from the Stepwise Calculation Matches the PCA from the Scikit Learn Library. However, since there are various steps that are extensive in nature, we will now use the <code>SkLearn PCA</code> henceforth.

#### 2.3.15 **PCA - Captured Variance and Data Lost**

`Explained Variance Ratio` is the ratio between the variance attributed by each selected principal component and the total variance. Total variance is the sum of variances of all individual principal components. Multiplying this explained variance ratio with 100, we get the percentage of variance ascribed by each chosen principal component & subtracting the sum of variances from 1 gives us the total loss in variance.

Hence, the PCA Components Variance are as follows :

```python
round_to=2                                                     # round off values to 2
explained_variance = pca.explained_variance_ratio_             # get the explained variance ratio

# perform pretty display of ratio percentages
for i,e in enumerate(explained_variance):
  print("Principal Component",i+1,"- Explained Variance Percentage :" , round(e*100,round_to))

total_variance=explained_variance.sum()                        # get the total sum of the variance ratios obtained
print("Total Variance Percentage Captured :",round(total_variance*100,round_to))

var_loss=1 - total_variance                                    # calculate the loss in variance
print("Total Variance Percentage Loss :",round(var_loss*100,round_to))
```

    Principal Component 1 - Explained Variance Percentage : 98.2
    Principal Component 2 - Explained Variance Percentage : 1.62
    Total Variance Percentage Captured : 99.82
    Total Variance Percentage Loss : 0.18

#### 2.3.16 **PCA Visualizations**

Visual Insights to PCA on the Breast Cancer Dataset will help us understand breast cancer classification in a better way and is definitely a requirement for better Data Insights.

**Dataframe Preparation :**

First we will prepare the pandas dataframe for visualizing the 2-D and 3-D PCA after applying PCA with the respective number of components (n_components).

```python
pca_2d = PCA(n_components= 2)       # use 2-component PCA
PCA_2D = pca_2d.fit_transform(X)    # fit the 2-component PCA

pca_3d = PCA(n_components= 3)       # use 3-component PCA
PCA_3D = pca_3d.fit_transform(X)    # fit the 3-component PCA

print("Shape of PCA 2D :",PCA_2D.shape,"Shape of PCA 3D :",PCA_3D.shape) # display shapes
```

    Shape of PCA 2D : (569, 2) Shape of PCA 3D : (569, 3)

```python

             , columns = ['PCA-2D-one', 'PCA-2D-two','PCA-3D-one', 'PCA-3D-two','PCA-3D-three'])
# create a dataframe of the applied PCA in 2-D & 3-D
PCA_df["label"]=df["label"]                  # assign label column to previously assigned labels
print("Shape of PCA dataframe",PCA_df.shape) # display shape of resulting PCA dataframe

#### 2.3.18 **An Introduction to Classification Modelling with Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

**Support Vector Machines (SVM)** is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that can be used for both Classification and Regression problems, though it is mostly used in classification problem to distinctly classify the data points.

The primary objective of an SVM Classifier is to find out a decision boundary in the n-dimensional space (where n is number of features) that will segregate the space into two regions where in one region the hypothesis predicts that y=1 and in another region the hypothesis predicts that y=0.

This decision boundary is also called a **hyperplane**. There could be many possible hyperplanes but the goal of SVM is to choose those extreme points or vectors which will help to create one hyperplane that will have **maximum margin** i.e. maximum distance between the data points of two regions or classes. The hyperplane with maximum margin is termed as **optimal hyperplane**. Those extreme points or vectors are called Support Vectors and hence, this algorithm is termed as Support Vector Machine.

Given a training data of $$n$$ points : $$\left(\vec{x}_{i}, y_{i}\right)$$ where $$y_{i}=0 \text{ or } 1$$

<!--
$$
\left(\vec{x}_{1}, y_{1}\right), \ldots,\left(\vec{x}_{n}, y_{n}\right)
$$
-->

![SVM_Working.jpg](/assets/images/DIM_REDN/SVM_Working.jpg)

The Mathematical Formulation,

$$
\min \frac{\|\vec{w} \|^{2}}{2} \quad \text { such that } y_{i}\left(\vec{w} \cdot x_{i}+b\right)-1 \geq 0 \quad \text { for } i=1 \ldots n
$$

where,

$$
\vec{w} \text { is the normal vector to the hyperplane. }
$$

$$b \geq 0 \text { is the distance from the origin to the plane (or line).}$$

#### 2.3.19 **Types of SVM**

**Linear SVM :**  
If all the data points in n-dimensional space can be classified into two different regions using a straight line then such data is termed as linearly separable data and the classifier used is termed as Linear SVM Classifier. Suppose in a dataset we have only two features G and R which are tagged Green and Red respectively in a 2-dimensional Space. We have to classify these two tags into two different classes.
Using a simple straight line we can easily classify these two classes in 2-D space. But they can have multiple lines competing for the classifier. Here, the SVM algorithm helps to find out the best straight line or decision boundary where the distance or margin between the support vectors and hyperplane is maximum.

**Non Linear SVM :**  
If all the data points in n-dimensional space can't be classified into two different regions using a straight line then such data is termed as non linearly separable data and the classifier used is termed as Non Linear SVM Classifier.

The **Kernel Trick** is applied to train a linear classifier to provide predictions on a non-linear data space. It transforms the linearly inseparable data into a linearly separable one by high dimensional projections. Each data object is mapped using a kernel function to the original non-linear dataset that is then projected into some high dimensional set by which it becomes linearly separable.

**Train and Evaluate the SVM Models :**  
Kernels to use in Scikit Learn SVM Classification : {‘linear’, ‘poly’, ‘rbf’, ‘sigmoid’} , we will try out all of these kernels sequentially computing the best test accuracy and choosing that classifier.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC                        # import Support Vector Classifier
from sklearn import metrics                        # get the metrics used for evaluating accuracy

Kernels = ['linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid']     # List out all the kernels used in SVM
Ks= len(Kernels)                                   # get the no of kernels we will be using
# initilaize necessary vectors for storing the metric scores
mean_acc = np.zeros((Ks))
mean_acc_train= np.zeros((Ks))
std_acc = np.zeros((Ks))
std_acc_train = np.zeros((Ks))
for n in range(Ks):
    # Train Model and Predict
    clf = SVC(kernel=Kernels[n])
    classifier = clf.fit(X_train,y_train)
    yhat=classifier.predict(X_test)

    # Accumulate the scores for future use
    mean_acc[n] = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yhat) #gets the test accuracy
    y_pred=classifier.predict(X_train)
    mean_acc_train[n] = metrics.accuracy_score(y_train,y_pred) #gets the train accuracy

    # compute the normalized standard deviation
    std_acc[n]=np.std(yhat==y_test)/np.sqrt(yhat.shape[0])
    std_acc_train[n]=np.std(y_pred==y_train)/np.sqrt(y_pred.shape[0])
```

**Obtain the Highest Test Accuracy Model :**  
Extract the best model from the list of kernel types :

```python
print("MEAN ACCURACY")
length=len(mean_acc)

# get the mean accuracy for each kernel type
for i in range(length):
    test_acc='{0:.3f}'.format(round(mean_acc[i],3))
    train_acc='{0:.3f}'.format(round(mean_acc_train[i],3))

    print("Kernel Type =",Kernels[i],"  Avg. Test Accuracy=",test_acc,"  Avg. Train Accuracy=",train_acc)
```

    MEAN ACCURACY
    Kernel Type = linear   Avg. Test Accuracy= 0.947   Avg. Train Accuracy= 0.923
    Kernel Type = poly   Avg. Test Accuracy= 0.851   Avg. Train Accuracy= 0.855
    Kernel Type = rbf   Avg. Test Accuracy= 0.921   Avg. Train Accuracy= 0.919
    Kernel Type = sigmoid   Avg. Test Accuracy= 0.825   Avg. Train Accuracy= 0.899

**Visualize the Evaluation Scores :**  
It is necessary to visualize the accuracy as these visualizations help us know whether the model is overfitting, underfitting or is just right.

```python
imt = mean_acc.argmax() # index of maximum test accuracy
print( "The best test accuracy was", mean_acc.max(), "with Kernel=", Kernels[imt])
print( "The corresponding training accuracy obtained was :",mean_acc_train[imt])

plt.figure(figsize=(15,7.5))
# set the figure size

# plot the mean accuracies and their standard deviations
plt.plot(range(Ks),mean_acc_train,'r',linewidth=5)
plt.plot(range(Ks),mean_acc,'g',linewidth=5)
plt.fill_between(range(Ks),mean_acc - 1 * std_acc,mean_acc + 1 * std_acc, alpha=0.10)
plt.fill_between(range(Ks),mean_acc_train - 1 * std_acc_train,mean_acc_train + 1 * std_acc_train, alpha=0.10)

# plot the points for Best Test Accuracy & Corresponding Train Accuracy.
plt.scatter( mean_acc.argmax(),  mean_acc.max(), zorder=3,s=60)
plt.scatter( mean_acc.argmax(),  mean_acc_train[mean_acc.argmax()],zorder=3,s=60)

# set up the legend
plt.legend(('Train_Accuracy ','Test_Accuracy ', '+/- 3xstd_test','+/- 3xstd_train','BEST_TEST_ACC','CORRESPONDING_TRAIN_ACC'))

# set plot metadata

plt.ylabel('Accuracy ',fontsize=16)                                                     # set the xlabels & ylabels
plt.xlabel('Kernel Type',fontsize=16)
plt.xticks(ticks=range(Ks),labels=Kernels,fontsize=14)                                  # set the xticks & yticks
plt.yticks(fontsize=14)

plt.tight_layout()                                                                      # set the tight layout for the plot


plt.savefig("Kernel Chosen vs Mean Training and Testing Accuracy Score.png",dpi=600)

**Finding the Optimal Model Hyperparameters :**

Often Machine Learning Engineers , use search algorithms such as [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) and [RandomizedSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html) to perform model hyperparameter fine tuning for optimal performance of the predictor. However, the implementation and detailed explaianation of these algorithms are beyond the scope of this book chapter.

#### 2.3.20 **Limitations of PCA**

Although PCA is a widely used algorithm for dimensionality reduction, it has its own limitations :

- PCA is a Linear Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm and hence chooses an eigenvector with a corresponding high eigenvalue. In some cases in the form of highly non linear data spaces, this approach will fail as the **NON LINEAR COMPONENTS** will be **TRUNCATED** (disregarded as noise) and will not count towards the model variance a lot. It assumes that a large variance results in a low covariance, which in turn implies high importance which may not be true 100% of the times. For this we need to shift to Kernel PCA (KPCA) which requires a lot of space.
- PCA is a **SCALE VARIANT** Algorithm, and hence any change of scale in any of the variables will affect the PCA values accordingly.
- For some data distributions, **MEAN & COVARIANCE DESCRIPTION IS INACCURATE**. It is only true to say that for the Gaussian/Normal Data Distributions, this algorithm performs actually well, but this may not be correct for other distributions.

#### 2.3.21 **PCA vs. t-SNE**

| Model Hyperparameters not Involved.                              | Model Hyperparameters - perplexity, learning rate and number of steps.  |
| Highly affected by data noise/outliers.                          | Handle outliers efficiently.                                            |

| Rotates the vectors for preserving variance.                     | Minimizes the distance between the points in a Gaussian distributution. |
